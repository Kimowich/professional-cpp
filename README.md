# Learning C++20 with "Professional C++ by Marc Gregoire"

This repository contains the code written during the reading of the book.

Currently the repository contains my knowledge up untill chapter 9 of the book and two code examples; Employee, Spreadsheet.

**Employee** shows basic knowledge of C++ using some simple classes in their header files.

**Spreadsheet** shows more advanced knowledge of dynamic memory allocation, class methods and data members.
